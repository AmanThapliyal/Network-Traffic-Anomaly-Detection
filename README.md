# Network-Traffic-Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection in network involves identifying deviations from normal network behavior that may indicate potential cyber threats. Instead of relying on predefined  signatures, anomaly detection methods use statistical models, machine learning, and deep  learning to analyze network traffic and distinguish between normal and malicious activities.
